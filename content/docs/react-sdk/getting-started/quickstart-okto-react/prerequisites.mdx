### Setup and Configuration

1. **React and Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have React set up in your project.
   - For a detailed list of required dependencies, refer to our [`package.json`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdk-react-template-app/blob/main/package.json).

2. **Okto API Key**
   - Obtain your API Key from the [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/).
   - This key is essential for integrating the Okto SDK into your project.

3. **Google Client ID**
   - To authenticate users via Google, you'll need to set up a Google Console Project.
   - Follow our guide to [set up your Google Console Project](/docs/react-sdk/advanced-sdk-config/authenticate-users/google-oauth/learn).

### Next Steps
