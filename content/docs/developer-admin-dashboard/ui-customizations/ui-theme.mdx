The UI Theme customization allows you to tailor the visual aspects of the Okto wallet integration to match your app's design. These customizations will reflect across all UI screens.

## **Global Customization Options**

Two main customization options apply across all UI screens:

1. **Theme Mode**  
   * Light Mode: Ideal for apps with a brighter, day-time focused interface.  
   * Dark Mode: Suitable for apps with a darker theme or to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.  
       
2. **Accent Color**  
   * Set using an RGB HEX value (e.g., \#5166EEFF)  
   * This color will be applied to key UI elements like buttons and icons across all screens.  
     

## **Applying UI Theme Customizations**

1. Navigate to the UI Theme section in the Okto dashboard.  
2. Select your preferred Theme Mode (Light or Dark).  
3. Enter your desired Accent Color using the RGB HEX value.  
4. Use the preview pane to see how your customizations look in real-time.  
5. Once satisfied, click "Publish" to apply your changes.
