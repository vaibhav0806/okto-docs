## App ID

![API Page - Okto Dashboard](/images/api-key-dashboard.png)

The App ID is a unique identifier for your application and you as a [Vendor](/docs/introduction-to-okto/okto-vendor-user). It's used to associate your Okto client with this specific app in our system. Include this ID when initializing your Okto client in your application.

To copy the App ID, click the "Copy" button next to it.

## App Secret

Your App Secret is not displayed for security reasons. To view or generate your App Secret, click the "Get App Secret" button.

The App Secret is a confidential key used to authenticate your API requests. Keep this secret secure and never share it publicly or include it in client-side code.

<Callout title="Note">
- App ID and App Secret pairs are unique for each environment (e.g., sandbox, production).  
- Ensure you're using the correct pair for the environment you're working in.  
- Okto does not store your API secret so keep it safe and secret.

**What are App ID and App Secret for Vendors?**

**App ID**: A public identifier for your application.

**App Secret**: A private key used to authenticate requests from your application to Okto's servers. It is also referred to as OKTO API KEY in the docs.

## Storing App Secret

* **How Okto stores it**: Okto does not store any vendorsâ€™ API secret. In case it's lost, you can reset the key.  
* **How you should store it**:  
  * Use environment variables or secure secret management systems.  
  * Never hardcode the secret in your application code.  
  * Avoid storing it in version control systems.

## Reset App Secret

* To reset your App Secret, use the "Reset" option next to your App Secret on the Okto dashboard.  
* After regeneration, update the secret in all your applications to maintain uninterrupted service.

<Callout title="Note">
  - If someone obtains your App ID and App Secret, they could potentially make unauthorized requests on behalf of your application.  
  - In case of a suspected breach, immediately regenerate your App Secret and update your applications.
