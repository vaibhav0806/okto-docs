## **What is Sponsorship?**

Sponsorship is a feature that allows you to cover transaction fees (gas fees) for your users. This creates a smoother user experience by removing the need for users to hold native tokens for transaction fees.

## **How Sponsorship Works with Okto Across Ecosystems**

Sponsorship integrates with Okto's wallet infrastructure to automatically cover gas fees for transactions on supported chains. When a user initiates a transaction, the sponsorship system pays the required gas fee, allowing the transaction to proceed even if the user doesn't have the native token for gas.

## **Prerequisites**

* Enable chains in your Okto dashboard  
* Activate sponsorship for each desired chain  
* Load native tokens into your sponsorship account


## **Loading Funds to Sponsorship**

1. Only native tokens of the respective chains can be loaded into sponsorship accounts.  
2. Each chain has a unique sponsorship address. You can find this address in your Okto dashboard.  
3. For testnets, you can use faucets to acquire tokens. 

## **Sponsorship Necessity**

Sponsorship is compulsory for Solana but optional for other chains. You can disable sponsorship on the admin panel if activated. If not activated, you don't need to activate it until you need to use it.

## **Sponsorship Usage Across Chains**

* All chains: Gas fees  
* Aptos and Solana: Account creation and initiation  
* Solana specific: SPL ATA accounts, nonce advancement, rent

## **Sponsorship Authority and Security**

You have full authority over your sponsorship account. Neither Okto nor any third party can drain your sponsorship funds.

## **Recommended Minimum Amounts**

Recommended minimum amounts vary by chain.
