## **Steps to Set Up Sponsorship**

1. Enable desired chains in your Okto dashboard  
2. Activate sponsorship for each chain  
3. Add native funds via airdrop or transfer to the sponsorship address  
4. Enable/disable sponsorship as needed  
   

## **Activating Sponsorship**

Activating sponsorship means you're opting to cover gas fees for your users' transactions on the selected chain.

## **Transaction Coverage**

Currently, all transactions for your users are covered by your sponsorship. In future updates, you'll be able to set conditions for sponsorship coverage.

## **Sponsorship Usage Across Vendors**

Okto selects the appropriate sponsorship account based on the vendor ID, ensuring your funds are only used for transactions within your application.

## **Viewing Transaction History**

You can view the history of transactions paid by your sponsorship account via the block explorer for each respective chain.

## **Low Balance Scenarios**

If your sponsorship account balance is low:

1. You'll receive notifications via the SDK and API. 
2. You can either recharge the account or disable sponsorship to prevent transaction failures.  
   

## **Best Practices**

1. Regularly monitor your sponsorship account balances.  
2. Consider the transaction volume and gas prices on each chain when funding your sponsorship accounts.  
3. Periodically review your sponsorship strategy to ensure it aligns with your application's needs and user behavior.
