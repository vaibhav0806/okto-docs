## Linking Main Okto App Profile with SDK

Integrating the main **Okto app profile** with the SDK is crucial for ensuring seamless interaction between the app and the SDK. This integration allows for:

- **Unified User Experience**: Users can access and manage their wallets and transactions from the Okto app, while developers can leverage the SDK for embedding wallet functionalities into their applications.
- **Consistent Profile Management**: Linking ensures that user profiles and wallet data are synchronized across both the Okto app and the SDK, providing a cohesive experience.

To link the Okto app profile with the SDK:

1. **Setup SDK**: Integrate the Okto SDK into your application by following the setup instructions provided in the [Okto SDK Documentation](#).
2. **Authenticate Profile**: Use the SDK to authenticate users and link their profiles with the Okto app. This involves passing user credentials and ensuring secure communication between the app and the SDK.
3. **Synchronize Data**: Ensure that user wallet data and profile information are consistently updated across both platforms.

## Our Path to Decentralization

Okto is committed to decentralization, working towards creating a more open and transparent ecosystem. Our **path to decentralization** includes the development of the Okto chain, which will facilitate a more decentralized approach to managing transactions and user data.

- **Okto Chain**: The Okto chain is a critical component in our decentralization strategy. It aims to enhance security, scalability, and decentralization within the Okto ecosystem.
  
  - **Whitepaper**: Learn more about our vision for the Okto chain in the [Okto Chain Whitepaper](#).
  - **Blogs**: Stay updated with our progress and insights by reading our [Okto Decentralization Blogs](#).

## Users' Wallet Ecosystem Inside Okto

The user wallet ecosystem within Okto is designed to provide flexibility and ease of use through different models:

1. **Interoperable Wallets**: Users can access and manage their wallets across multiple blockchain networks through Okto’s interoperable wallets. This ensures that users can interact with various decentralized applications (dApps) and services seamlessly.

2. **Closed-Loop Wallets**: For specific applications or use cases, Okto also supports closed-loop wallets. These are tailored to function within a single platform or ecosystem, providing a more controlled environment for transactions and asset management.

3. **Okto App - Single Access and Management**: The Okto app serves as a central hub for wallet management. Users can access all their wallets, whether interoperable or closed-loop, from a single application. This unified approach simplifies the management of multiple wallets and enhances the user experience.

## Conclusion

Linking the Okto app profile with the SDK ensures seamless integration and a unified user experience. Our commitment to decentralization is exemplified by the development of the Okto chain, detailed in our whitepaper and blogs. The Okto wallet ecosystem provides users with flexible options, from interoperable to closed-loop wallets, all managed through a single access point in the Okto app.
