## Introduction to Personas in Okto Documentation

In the Okto documentation, you'll frequently encounter three main personas: Okto, Vendor, and User. These personas are key to navigating how Okto interacts with developers and users across its platform. Let's break down each of these roles to understand their place in the ecosystem.

## 1. Okto

### Who is Okto?

Okto refers to our company, our platform, and the suite of services we provide.

### What does Okto do?
- Provides the underlying infrastructure for blockchain interactions
- Offers tools, APIs, and wallet functionalities
- Acts as a bridge connecting Vendors and Users
- Manages the orchestration layer that simplifies blockchain complexity

### Key Points
- Okto is the foundation of the ecosystem
- We handle the complex aspects of blockchain technology
- Our goal is to make Web3 accessible to both developers and end-users

## 2. Vendor

### Who is a Vendor? 
A Vendor is any developer or company building an application that integrates Okto's services.

### What does a Vendor do?
- Builds applications using Okto's API and SDK
- Integrates Okto's wallet and services into their own apps
- Serves as the intermediary bringing Okto's functionalities to end-users

### Key Points
- Each Vendor has a unique Vendor ID
- Vendors receive an API ID and secret for secure integration
- Vendors can onboard Users to the Okto ecosystem through their apps

### Example
Imagine a company called "CryptoGame" developing a blockchain-based game. They use Okto's SDK to handle in-game transactions and asset management. CryptoGame is a Vendor in the Okto ecosystem.

## 3. User

### Who is a User? 
A User is any individual who interacts with a Vendor's application and, by extension, uses Okto's services.

### What does an User do?
- Interacts with Vendor applications
- Manages wallets, sends tokens, and engages with blockchain features
- Benefits from the simplified blockchain experience provided by Okto and the Vendor

### Key Points
- Each User has a unique User ID within the Okto ecosystem
- Users can interact with multiple Vendor apps using the same Okto account
- User experiences are tailored by Vendors but powered by Okto

### Example
Sarah downloads CryptoGame on her smartphone. When she creates an account, she becomes a User in the Okto ecosystem, even if she's not directly aware of Okto's involvement.

## Unique Identification System

Understanding how we identify Vendors and Users is crucial for effective integration and management.

### Vendor Identification

- Each Vendor receives a unique Vendor ID
- Vendors also get an API ID and secret for secure API calls
- This system ensures each Vendor's app is distinctly recognized on our platform

### User Identification

- Every User is assigned a unique User ID
- This ID manages their interactions, wallets, and transactions across the Okto ecosystem
- The same User ID works across multiple Vendor apps, providing a unified experience
- Since Okto is interoperable, the same user ID can be associated with multiple Vendor apps, allowing Users to have a unified experience across different applications while leveraging the same Okto infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Understanding the roles of Okto, Vendor, and User is fundamental to navigating our ecosystem:
- **Okto** provides the infrastructure and simplifies blockchain complexity
- **Vendors** build applications that leverage Okto's capabilities
- **Users** enjoy blockchain features through Vendor apps, powered by Okto

These terms help frame the relationships and interactions within the ecosystem, ensuring that developers and users can effectively use Okto’s interoperable and powerful tools. The unique identification system via **vendor ID** and **user ID** ensures secure and seamless operations for Vendors and Users alike.
