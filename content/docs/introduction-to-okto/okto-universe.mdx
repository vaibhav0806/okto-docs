## The Path to Decentralization: Introducing the Okto Chain

While our current implementation behind Okto Lite is largely centralized, we're committed to embracing the core values of Web3. That's why we're excited to announce the development of our own blockchain: the Okto Chain.

The Okto Chain is designed to:
- Facilitate decentralized transaction management
- Operate in an account and chain-abstracted manner
- Ease user burden in the fragmented blockchain ecosystem

It's important to note that the Okto Chain won't hold any Total Value Locked (TVL). Instead, it will serve as a backbone for our orchestration layer, aligning with Web3 principles of transparency and decentralization.
