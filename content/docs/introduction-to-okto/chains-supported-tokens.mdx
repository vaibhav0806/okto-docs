## Supported Chains 

The Okto SDK supports multiple blockchain networks, offering a wide range of functionality across different ecosystems. Our system is designed to stay up-to-date, automatically fetching the latest chain information from our central database. This ensures that you always have access to the most current capabilities without needing manual updates.

Let's look at some example chains to understand what information is available for each supported network:

### Polygon

- **Chain Name**: Polygon 
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports token transfers, smart contract interactions, and staking mechanisms.
- **User Wallet Example**: A user wallet on Polygon will be generated as part of Okto's embedded wallet system. Example address: `0xabc123...789xyz`. This address is stored securely and mapped to a unique user ID, such as `user_12345`.
- **Testnet Support**: Yes, Polygon Amoy testnet is supported.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes POL, USDC and USDT.
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Supported in both Sandbox and Production environments.

### Solana

- **Chain Name**: Solana
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports high-speed transactions, smart contracts (called programs), and token creation.
- **User Wallet Example**: A Solana wallet in Okto's system might look like: `5XR4KYM1SEV2Ezf8ubqi8aSn4wYzRGi1xYBNHSZ8dSuR`. This is mapped to a user ID like `user_67890`.
- **Testnet Support**: Yes, Solana Devnet is supported.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes SOL, USDC, and USDT.
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Available in both Sandbox and Production environments.

### Base

- **Chain Name**: Base
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports Ethereum-compatible smart contracts, token transfers, and DeFi applications.
- **User Wallet Example**: A Base wallet address in Okto would be similar to Ethereum, e.g., `0xdef456...321uvw`. This is securely stored and associated with a user ID such as `user_24680`.
- **Testnet Support**: No, testnet for Base is not supported yet.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes ETH and USDC.
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Supported in both Sandbox and Production environments.

### Aptos

- **Chain Name**: Aptos
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports fast transactions, smart contracts written in Move language, and token operations.
- **User Wallet Example**: An Aptos wallet in Okto might be represented as: `0x1a2b3c...7x8y9z`. This is mapped to a unique user identifier like `user_13579`.
- **Testnet Support**: Yes, Aptos Testnet is supported.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes APT and USDT.
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Available in both Sandbox and Production environments.

## Conclusion

The Okto SDK offers robust support for multiple blockchain networks, providing you with the tools to build cross-chain applications with ease. By offering automatic updates on chain functionality, testnet support, and a unified wallet structure, we aim to simplify your development process.

Remember to always check the latest information for each chain you're working with, as capabilities and token support may evolve over time. If you have any questions about a specific chain or token, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
