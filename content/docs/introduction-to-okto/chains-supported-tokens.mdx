## Supported Chains and Functionality

The Okto SDK supports multiple blockchain networks, offering a wide range of functionality across different ecosystems. Our system is designed to stay up-to-date, automatically fetching the latest chain information from our central database. This ensures that you always have access to the most current capabilities without needing manual updates.

Let's look at some example chains to understand what information is available for each supported network:

### Polygon

- **Chain Name**: Polygon (Matic)
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports token transfers, smart contract interactions, and staking mechanisms.
- **User Wallet Example**: A user wallet on Polygon will be generated as part of Okto's embedded wallet system. Example address: `0xabc123...789xyz`. This address is stored securely and mapped to a unique user ID, such as `user_12345`.
- **Testnet Support**: Yes, Polygon Amoy testnet is supported.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes MATIC, USDC, DAI, etc.
- **Token Whitelisting Process**: Currently, the whitelisting of new tokens is not available directly via the SDK. Contact support for token listing inquiries.
- **Explorer Links**:
- [Polygon Mainnet Explorer](https://polygonscan.com)
- [Polygon Testnet Explorer](https://amoy.polygonscan.com)
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Supported in both Sandbox and Production environments. For more details, refer to the [Admin Panel Documentation](#).

### Ethereum

- **Chain Name**: Ethereum
- **Chain Functionality**: Supports ERC-20 token transfers, smart contract interactions, and DeFi integrations.
- **User Wallet Example**: Example address: `0xdef456...012ghi`. Mapped to user ID `user_67890`.
- **Testnet Support**: Yes, Sepolia testnet is supported.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Includes ETH, USDT, USDC, etc.
- **Token Whitelisting Process**: Not available directly. Reach out for adding new tokens.
- **Explorer Links**:
- [Ethereum Mainnet Explorer](https://etherscan.io)
- [Sepolia Testnet Explorer](https://sepolia.etherscan.io)
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Supported in both Sandbox and Production environments. For more details, refer to the [Admin Panel Documentation](#).

### Additional Chains

For each chain, similar details are available regarding:

- **Functionality**: Details on token support, smart contracts, and other specific features.
- **User Wallet**: Example wallet addresses, and user ID mappings are provided to illustrate how wallets are managed.
- **Testnet Support**: Available testnets and relevant explorer links.
- **Whitelisted Tokens**: Listing of supported tokens, along with the process to whitelist new tokens (if applicable).
- **Explorer Links**: Direct links to the respective blockchain explorers for both mainnets and testnets.
- **Sandbox and Production Availability**: Each chain will indicate if it's available in Sandbox or Production environments. For more details, refer to the [Admin Panel Documentation](#).

## Solidity Development Resources

For developers building on the supported chains, here are some valuable Solidity development resources:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://soliditylang.org/docs/)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [Hardhat Development Environment](https://hardhat.org/)
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/)

These tools and resources will help you develop and test smart contracts across the various chains supported by the Okto SDK.

## Conclusion

The Okto SDK offers robust support for multiple blockchain networks, providing you with the tools to build cross-chain applications with ease. By offering automatic updates on chain functionality, testnet support, and a unified wallet structure, we aim to simplify your development process.

Remember to always check the latest information for each chain you're working with, as capabilities and token support may evolve over time. If you have any questions about a specific chain or token, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
