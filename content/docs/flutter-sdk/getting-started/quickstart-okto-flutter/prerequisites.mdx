### Setup and Configuration

1. **Flutter and Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Flutter installed and set up.
   - For a detailed list of required dependencies, refer to our [`pubspec.yaml`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdk-flutter-template-app/blob/main/pubspec.yaml).

2. **Okto API Key**
   - Obtain your API Key from the [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/).
   - This key is essential for integrating the Okto SDK into your project.

3. **Google Client IDs**
   - To authenticate users via Google, you'll need to set up a Google Console Project.
   - Follow our guide to [set up your Google Console Project](/docs/flutter-sdk/advanced-sdk-config/authenticate-users/google-oauth/google-console-setup).
   - The required Client IDs depend on your target platforms:

   | Target Platform | Required Client IDs |
   |-----------------|---------------------|
   | Android only    | - Android Client ID<br/>- Web Client ID |
   | iOS only        | - iOS Client ID |
   | Both Android and iOS | - Android Client ID<br/>- iOS Client ID<br/>- Web Client ID |

By default, your project will use the **Sandbox** environment. To switch to the **Production** environment, please refer to our [Admin Panel documentation](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/overview) for upgrade instructions.
