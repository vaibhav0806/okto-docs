### Setup and Configuration

1. **Dependencies**
   - For a detailed list of required dependencies, refer to our [`package.json`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdk-react-native-template-app/blob/main/package.json).

   | Android only    | - Android Client ID<br/>- Web Client ID |
   | iOS only        | - iOS Client ID |
   | Both Android and iOS | - Android Client ID<br/>- iOS Client ID<br/>- Web Client ID |
