This document describes the authentication flow when using Google OAuth and the Okto React SDK. The diagram depicts the interaction between the vendor's client web app, the Google OAuth server, the Okto React SDK, and the Okto servers to authenticate a user, verify their credentials, and create or validate the user in the Okto system.

## Sequence Diagram Explanation

The sequence diagram illustrates the following steps:

### 1. Client Invokes Google Login
The user's login process begins when the vendor's client web app invokes Google Login by sending a request to the Google OAuth server.
### 2. Google OAuth Server Returns ID Token
Upon successful login, the Google OAuth server generates and sends an `id_token` to the client app, confirming the user's identity.
### 3. Client Invokes Okto React SDK Authentication
The client app then calls the `authenticate` method of the Okto React SDK, passing the `id_token` received from Google.
### 4. Okto React SDK Passes ID Token to Okto Servers
The Okto React SDK forwards the ID token to the Okto servers for verification.
### 5. Okto Servers Verify the ID Token
The Okto servers verify the validity of the ID token:
- If the token is verified successfully, the Okto servers check if a user exists with the email associated with the ID token.
- If the user exists, the process continues.
- If the user does not exist, a new user is created.
- If verification fails, the process ends with an error
### 6. Okto Servers Send Okto Auth Token
Once the ID token is verified and user creation or validation is complete, the Okto servers generate and send an Okto authentication token to the Okto React SDK.
### 7. Okto React SDK Returns Auth Token or Error to Client
The Okto React SDK returns the Okto authentication token to the client web app. If an error occurred during verification, the SDK returns an error instead.

## Conclusion
This authentication flow ensures a secure and streamlined process by combining Google OAuth with Oktoâ€™s infrastructure. After the user successfully logs in with Google, Okto handles the verification and user management, returning a unique authentication token to the client. This token can be used to grant access to protected resources or services, all while maintaining user security and a seamless experience.
